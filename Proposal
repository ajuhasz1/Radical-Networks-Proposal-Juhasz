## Talk

## Over the past year or so I worked with others on and in my “ev-ent-anglement,” a living experiment that demonstrates in the doing many of the affordances of contemporary corporate (feminist) social media and its potential alternative networks. The project traveled the globe, considering how we might do better with the uncountable fragments of ourselves that we willingly, massively and generatively give to the man with every tweet, click, and photo. It asks instead: what if we gave them to each other?

My talk will look to the images that were gifted to me (through Twitter, Facebook, my blog and website) at one of the events, held in Montreal at a meeting of feminist theorists. I asked that audience to practice, and thereby theorize, a feminist procedure of digital and social (self) editing by cutting, linking, looping, sharing and thereby revisiting and remaking from the past media of a/their vast digital fragment archive. At the Radical Networks meeting, I will look at and theorize from the objects that were made, unmade, and not made by some international feminist intellectuals and artists who cut and paste our fragments together making use of feminist principles towards anti-corporate ends. 

Technologies, like people, slide over some things, stick others together, allow for friction, cuts, pain and pleasure. Parts of us stay put, others travel on. I will consider how and what we can save, pass, know, and be moved by, together, within social media and/or radical networks of our own design. I will consider: What is the glue that inspires or captivates a group to linger, act, and assemble? 
 
My project shows that there is something that exceeds the mimetic copy of some part of yourself or others—so effortlessly passed along as a digital visual fragment. We have affect in our social network: our bodies, and poetry, and images, dance, words and humor as reminder, and as media, to get us ever closer to that evanescent event.
